Welcome to Roon's TF2C Server, which has the record of first Team Fortress 2 Classic server located in asia, dedicated to asian TF2 players.

Currently we only host only official maps, and doesn't have plan to support custom maps.
Our server's map rotations can be found here: https://github.com/RoonMoonlight/Project-Asia/blob/master/mapcycle.txt

To avoid intimidating players, our servers are NOT moderated by admin.
Instead, players are responsible for using the available in-game tools to police their server to their preferences, just like in Valve's casual servers.
Bans will only be issued to bots, cheaters, stalkers, etc.

Server hosting costs money. If you enjoyed playing on our server, please consider buying us a coffee from Ko-Fi: https://ko-fi.com/mysticmoonlight

Have fun!
